# Linux Threat Detection (AI-Assisted)

A lightweight host-based monitoring and anomaly detection project for Linux.  
Collects system telemetry (metrics + security signals), builds a baseline of normal behavior, and flags anomalies using unsupervised ML.

## Current Status
- [x] Metrics collector (CPU, memory, process count)
- [ ] Baseline training
- [ ] Anomaly detection + alert logging
- [ ] CI pipeline (lint/tests)
- [ ] Hardening notes + minimal system controls
