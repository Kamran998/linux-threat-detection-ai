# Linux Threat Detection Agent

A lightweight Linux host-based threat detection agent built with Python.

The agent monitors system activity and authentication logs, detects anomalous behavior using unsupervised machine learning, and generates structured security alerts.

## Features
- Host telemetry collection (CPU, memory, process count)
- Unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
- SSH authentication monitoring and brute-force detection
- Sudo usage and account change detection
- JSON-based alert logging
- systemd user service for continuous operation

## Status
This project is a functional prototype intended for learning, research, and portfolio demonstration.
